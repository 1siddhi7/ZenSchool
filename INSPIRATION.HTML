<B>“We must learn to trust Human Nature and educate children in such a way that they can develop their Human Potential. This is the only way we can bring real peace to the world. There is only one problem and it is Human Development in its totality; once this is achieved in any unit – Child or Nation – everything else follows spontaneously and harmoniously.”</B> <BR>

<FONT SIZE=6>What does ZEN mean? The word ZEN is a Japanese attempt at pronouncing the Chinese word “Chan”, which in turn is the Chinese attempt at pronouncing the Sanskrit word“Dhyana”, which translates as “Meditation”. When one intellectually dwells in the present moment, one completely dissolves into whatever activity one manifests. One becomes the activity. Simplicity is often associated with ZEN. ZEN practice is indeed simple, if not easy. Just practice being fully present, right here, right now. Perceive directly, without filtering perceptions through beliefs and preconceptions.<BR><BR></FONT>
